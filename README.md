# I2K2024(virtual): Bio-Image Analysis Code Generation

This repository contains training materials for the Tutorial "Bio-Image Analysis Code Generation" at the From Images To Knowledge (I2K) Conference (virtual) October 28th-30th 2024.

It contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating [bia-bob](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob), an AI-based assistant for interacting with image data using large language models and for working on Bio-image Analysis tasks. If you plan to execute these notebooks during the session, it is recommended to setup a Conda environment as [explained here](https://scads.github.io/generative-ai-notebooks/00_setup/readme.html).

Furthermore, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/i2k2024-ai-code-generation/issues/new/choose) which will then be answered by [git-bob](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob) an AI-assistant that runs inside Github.com's Continuous Integration infrastructure.

**Note:** When using bia-bob and git-bob, the data you provide, the images and the text you enter may be sent to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s or [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api)'s online services where we use a large language model to answer your request. 
Do not upload any data you cannot share openly. Also, do not enter any private or secret information.

## Feedback welcome

If you tried git-bob on your own, you also directly provide feedback to the AI-assistant by [opening an issue on its repository](i2k2024-ai-code-generation).
